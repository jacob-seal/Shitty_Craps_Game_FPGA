# Shitty-Craps_game_Nandland_GoBoard
 The best Shitty Craps game currently available for the Nandland GoBoard. Feel that Vegas excitement!
 
 
 Developed by Jacob Seal, for funsies. 
 Anyone can use this code for any reason. I don't care, really. 
 
 The GoBoard is not particularly powerful, so VGA implementation was a bear. I had to scale way back on what I planned. But the game is playable.
