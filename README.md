# Shitty-Craps_game_FPGA
 The best Shitty Craps game currently available for the Nandland GoBoard. Feel that Vegas excitement!
 
 
 Developed by Jacob Seal, for funsies. 
 Anyone can use this code for any reason. I don't care, really. 
 
 The game accepts a bet over UART, then you press switch 4 on the GoBoard to roll. There are 2 instantiations of psuedo-random electronic dice. From here it    plays like casino rules Craps, but no bet totals are calculated. 
 
 The GoBoard is not particularly powerful, so VGA implementation was a bear. I had to scale way back on what I planned. But the game is playable. 
 
 To find all the required modules to build the project, look in my other repositories:

 https://github.com/jacob-seal/FPGA_toolbox
 
 Everything is found there
 
 Further developement is planned when I can upgrade to a bigger board.
